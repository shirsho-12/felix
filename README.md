Translating for Justice

## Felix Felicis

With Felix, it solves the problem of delays and miscommunication, reducing the number of human errors. As Felix operates instantly in real time after someone speaks, it eases the burden on the interpreters as they may miss some pointers while attempting to translate the witness’s or judge’s words. Although we recognise that court interpreters would have the necessary qualifications, Felix makes the job easier. Additionally, it is an alternative if a translator is unavailable or delayed.
